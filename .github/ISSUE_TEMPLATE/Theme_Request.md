## Requirement Checklist:
Please check each box by replacing the space between the brackets with an 'x'.
- [ ] This theme is for a controller that is, was, or will soon be, a commercially-available game controller, such as the Microsoft Xbox One Controller (is), [Dempa XE-1 AP](https://segaretro.org/XE-1_AP) (was), or DualSense gamepad (will be).
- [ ] This controller's input can be detected via the HTML5 Gamepad API, the OJD Server, or RetroSpy. (The developer will not implement input detection for specific, individual devices.)
- [ ] This controller's input can be represented in two-dimensional space. (The developer isn't touching WebGL or WebGPU anytime soon.)
- [ ] I am not submitting a theme to be included in the default themes. (Please submit a pull request instead, consisting of JUST the themes/styles you are requesting the addition of.)
- [ ] I have checked [Formedras/ojd-themes](https://github.com/Formedras/ojd-themes) to see if my desired theme already exists there.
### Acknowledgements (Also required):
- [ ] I acknowledge that the developer may not have the time or ability to implement my request, and is unlikely to be able to obtain the requested controller.
- [ ] I will not complain if this request goes unanswered or is replied to as "Will not implement" for any rational reason.
- [ ] I will not complain if the theme is created but a profile mapping is not implemented.
- [ ] If the theme is created, but it sucks, I will attempt to improve it myself before complaining.

## Controller:
(Please replace this line with the controller's name and a relevant link to show the controller and hopefully how it works.)
